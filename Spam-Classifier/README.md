# Spam Classifiier
In this python program, I implemented the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify spam.

The dataset used is a subset of 2005 TREC Public Spam Corpus. It contains a training set and a test set. Both files use the same format: each line represents the space-delimited properties of an email, with the first one being the email ID, the second one being whether it is a spam or ham (non-spam), and the rest are words and their occurrence numbers in this email.

Command to run the program:

``python q2_classifier.py -f1 train -f2 test -o q2_output.csv``

This project was done during AI course, Fall 2019.
